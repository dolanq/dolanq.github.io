Hello world my name is Quinn Dolan, I am 22 years old and was born and raised here on the isle of Oahu. During my childhood I lived in Waikele and went to Waikele Elem. After my grandparent's fell ill our family moved into their home in Pearl City. I graduated from PCHS in 2017, with my two sisters (we look nothing alike) who are the same age as me and where born on the same day hence the term triplet. I was in marching band for the entirety of high school, I played the trumpet. However I haven't played in 4 years. Both my sisters are on the mainland after already after finishing their bachelor's degree. Since I took one gap semester and random classes and switched my major I am over year behind.(should have finished BA last semester.

Some other interesting facts about me is I am left-handed, I have mild Deuteranopia and require glasses. I was born 2 months premature and had asthma as a child.
Since I was never very good at sports growing up, I opted to say indoors and play with video games and the internet.
I am half-japanese on my moms side and always been interested in Japanese language and culture, from Anime, Music, etc. I took Japanese all throughout Highschool.
I orginally went to Hawaii Tokai University in West-Oahu campus but could't take the pressure of not speaking Japanese, when no one else spoke english.
Recently I have been into Russian War music I made a playlist on Youtube, link is on this site's homepage.
I am taking MIS major because I've always been interested in technology and it seemed like the most practical choice for a career compaired to political science (my original major).
