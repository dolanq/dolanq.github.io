Hello world my name is Quinn Dolan, I am 22 years old and was born and raised here on the isle of Oahu. During my childhood I lived in Waikele and went to Waikele Elem. After my grandparent's fell ill our family moved into their home in Pearl City. I graduated from PCHS in 2017, with my two sisters (we look nothing alike) who are the same age as me and were born on the same day hence the term triplet. I was in the marching band for the entirety of high school, I played the trumpet. However I haven't played in 4 years. Both my sisters are on the mainland after finishing their bachelor's degree. Since I took one gap semester and random classes and switched my major I am over a year behind; should have finished my BA last semester in Spring 2021.

Some other interesting facts about me is I am left-handed, I have mild Deuteranopia and require glasses. I was born 2 months premature and had asthma as a child. Since I was never very good at sports growing up, I opted to stay indoors and play video games and surf the internet. 

I am half-Japanese on my mom's side and have always been interested in Japanese language and culture, from Anime, Music, etc. I took Japanese all throughout High School. I originally went to Hawaii Tokai University in West-Oahu campus but couldn't take the pressure of not speaking Japanese, when no one else spoke english. 
My mother was born in Japan but was adopted to Japanese parents in Hawaii at 2 years old, my Dad is from California but grew up in Minnapolis, Minnesota left when he was 13 and lived on this own. They met in college at UH Manoa.

Recently I have been into Russian War music. I made a playlist on Youtube, link is on this site's homepage. I am taking a MIS major because I've always been interested in technology and it seemed like the most practical choice for a career compared to political science (my original major).

Some of my favorite video game series is the Metro series: 2033, 2034 and Exodus, Metroid Prime, Steins Gate, Hearts of Iron 4, Civilization 4/5.(there is a lot more, this is just off the top of my head)
