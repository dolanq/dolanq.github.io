Hello world my name is Quinn Dolan, I am 22 years old and was born and raised here on the isle of Oahu. During my childhood I lived in Waikele and went to Waikele Elem. After my grandparent's fell ill our family moved into their home in Pearl City. I graduated from PCHS in 2017, with my two sisters (we look nothing alike) who are the same age as me and where born on the same day hence the term triplet. I was in marching band for the entirety of high school, I played the trumpet. However I haven't played in 4 years.

Some other interesting facts about me is I am left-handed, I have mild Deuteranopia and poor vision requiring glasses. I was born 2 months premature and had asthma as a child.
I am half-japanese on my moms side and always been interested in Japanese language and culture, from Anime, Music, etc.
