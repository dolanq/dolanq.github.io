My BrowserHistory WOD journey began without a hitch... or so I thought.

The first issue I had was finding an adequate recording software to use. I thought that I could use the built in Game bar feature from Windows 10. However, it was only able to record one window at a time while I needed to capture the entire screen. My next choice was trying out OBS studio. I heard good things about it and knew actual Youtubers and Streamers who use it. So I guessed it couldn't be to bad. Sadly I was wrong.
