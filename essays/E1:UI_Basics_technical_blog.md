My BrowserHistory WOD journey began without a hitch... or so I thought.

The first issue I had was finding an adequate recording software to use. I thought that I could use the built in Game bar feature from Windows 10. However, it was only able to record one window at a time while I needed to capture the entire screen. My next choice was trying out OBS studio. I heard good things about it and knew actual Youtubers and Streamers who use it. So I guessed it couldn't be too bad. Sadly I was mistaken. Every time I tried to record (around 10 attempts) my voice would cut out each time I paused to take a breath or at the end of sentences. Then it took 3 seconds to come back in. I was very frustrating finishing a WOD only for your mic to be off 50% of the time and having to restart. I thought it was the settings or even the room I was in but nothing worked. So I asked the TA about it
