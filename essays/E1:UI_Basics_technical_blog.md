My BrowserHistory WOD journey began without a hitch... or so I thought.

The first issue I had was finding an adequate recording software to use. I thought that I could use the built in Game bar feature from Windows 10. However, it was only able to record one window at a time while I needed to capture the entire screen. My next choice was trying out OBS studio. I heard good things about it and knew actual Youtubers and Streamers who use it. So I guessed it couldn't be too bad. Sadly I was mistaken. Every time I tried to record (around 10 attempts) my voice would cut out each time I paused to take a breath or at the end of sentences. Then it took 3 seconds to come back in. I was very frustrating finishing a WOD only for your mic to be off 50% of the time and having to restart. I thought it was the settings or even the room I was in but nothing worked. So I asked the TA about it, and she said to try a different recording software, so I uninstalled obs and acquired flashback express. I was the one that the teacher used so it has to work I thought. I was underwelmed at the products age and its lacking features in the free version but I powered through. But it was midnight and over two hours had passed since I began trying to do the first WOD.

--The next morning--
  
I prepared myself for the worst praying that the new software would do what OBS could not. Luckly I was afraid of nothing the software worked fine and I uploaded it to Youtube. Finally, I fininshed the first one, two more to go. It took me around an hour to get the WOD completed in under 25 minutes, I took 3 tries in a row. What I learned from this wod was that practice makes perfect. I had to look up the answers so many times that eventually I remembered what to type without searching on the net. After I finished I watched the screencast of an example of how to do it. I quickly realized that I didn't do it the same way as the video. Which was a good think if it still works.
